# Anxiety Detection Using Digital Biomarkers and Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Abstract  
This study explores the relationship between **digital biomarkers** (e.g., hormonal levels, heart rate variability, and sleep patterns) and anxiety disorders using machine learning algorithms. The research highlights the potential of integrating AI and molecular data for early diagnosis and personalized treatment of anxiety.
