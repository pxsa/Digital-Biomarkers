# Anxiety Detection Using Digital Biomarkers and Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Abstract  
This study explores the relationship between **digital biomarkers** (e.g., hormonal levels, heart rate variability, and sleep patterns) and anxiety disorders using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing clinical and biological data from patients, models such as **SVM**, **Random Forest**, and **Neural Networks** achieved over **85% accuracy** in distinguishing individuals with anxiety from healthy controls. The research highlights the potential of integrating AI and molecular data for early diagnosis and personalized treatment of anxiety.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Concepts  
- **Digital Biomarkers**: Physiological (HRV, EEG) and behavioral (sleep patterns) data collected from wearable devices.  
- **Machine Learning**: Supervised and unsupervised algorithms for objective anxiety detection.  
- **Challenges**: Data heterogeneity, model interpretability, and privacy concerns.

## ðŸš€ Research Goals  
1. Identify the most predictive biomarkers for anxiety.  
2. Develop high-accuracy ML models for diagnosis.  
3. Address limitations like noisy/imbalanced data.

## ðŸ”¬ Methodology  
- **Data**: Biological samples + clinical records (anxiety patients vs. controls).  
- **Preprocessing**: Feature selection using **PCA** and **SelectKBest**.  
- **Models**: SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
